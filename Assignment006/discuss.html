<li><p>Did one of the data sets prove more challenging than the others?</p>

<p>Data as follow:</p>

<pre><code>-breast-cancer.arff-
 noise:     17/1140=1.49%
 precision: 139/178=78.09%
 recall:    139/203=68.47%
 accuracy:  182/285=63.86%
-nursery.arff-
 noise:     0/51840=0.00%
 precision: 4332/4332=100.00%
 recall:    4332/4332=100.00%
 accuracy:  8338/8338=100.00%
</code></pre>

<p><code>nursery.arff</code> has no noise, accuracy is <code>100.00%</code>, but <code>breast-cancer.arff</code> just has <code>64%</code>, which means it's much more challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>What was the difference between training and test set accuracy? Was your tree overfitting on any of the data sets?</p>

<p>Basically the accuracy of the training dataset would be higher than the test dataset.</p>

<p>Accuracy of the training dataset is <code>100% - noise</code>. In <code>breast-cancer.arff</code>, the accuracy of the training dataset is <code>98.51%</code>. It's much higher than the accuracy of the test dataset. It means in this case it's overfitting. <code>nursery.arff</code> doesn't have this problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Did it appears that any of the datasets was noisy or had other interesting issues?</p>

<p><code>breast-cancer.arff</code> has less than <code>2%</code> noise, <code>nursery.arff</code> even has no noise.</p>

<p><code>breast-cancer.arff</code> has one more attributes to test than <code>nursery.arff</code>, but <code>nursery.arff</code>'s accuracy is <code>100%</code> much higher than <code>breast-cancer.arff</code>. This tells us the size of the dataset is much more important to the accuracy than the numbers of the attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>Did the trees look very different between the different folds?</p>

<p>It's pretty stable. For <code>breast-cancer.arff</code>, it stay around <code>60%~70%</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
