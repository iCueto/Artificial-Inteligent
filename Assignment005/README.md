# TFIDF

Simply use:

    ./ir.py --infile corpus.pickle --classify TARGET_FILE ./

For more details of usage:

    ./ir.py -h

To test:

    ./tester.py

Input the number of tests then.

Loading pickle file is very slow, so I created a interactive environment for test.

Load once, test all the time.
